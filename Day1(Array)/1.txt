Duplicates in an array in O(n) and by using O(1) extra space

Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, 
you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array.

Your Task:
Complete the function duplicates() which takes array a[] and n as input as parameters and returns a list of elements that occur more than once in the given array in sorted manner. If no such element is found return -1. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).
Note : The extra space is only for the array to be returned.
Try and perform all operation withing the provided array. 

Example:
Sample Input:
2
4
0 3 1 2
5
2 3 1 2 3 

Sample Output:
-1
2 3 

Explanation:
Testcase 1: N=4 and all elements from 0 to (N-1 = 3) are present in the given array. Therefore output is -1.
Testcase 2: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.
