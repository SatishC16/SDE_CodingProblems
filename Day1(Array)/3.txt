Find Missing And Repeating

Given an unsorted array of size N of positive integers. 
One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. 
Find these two numbers.

Note: If you find multiple answers then print the Smallest number found. 
Also, expected solution is O(n) time and constant extra space.

Example:
Input:
2
2
2 2
3 
1 3 3

Output:
2 1
3 2

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.
Testcase 2: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.
